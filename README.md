THIS REPOSITORY FOR KTU CSL 203 OBJECT ORIENTED PROGRAMMING IN JAVA
1) Write a Java program that checks whether a given string is a palindrome or not. Ex: MALAYALAM is palindrome. 
2) Write a Java Program to find the frequency of a given character in a string. 
3) Write a Java program to multiply two given matrices. 
4) Write a Java program which creates a class named 'Employee' having the following  members: Name, Age, Phone number, Address, Salary. It also has a method named 'print Salary( )' which prints the salary of the Employee. Two classes 'Officer' and 'Manager'  inherits the 'Employee' class. The 'Officer' and 'Manager' classes have data members 'spe cialization' and 'department' respectively. Now, assign name, age, phone number, address  and salary to an officer and a manager by making an object of both of these classes and  print the same. (Exercise to understand inheritance). **  
5) Write a java program to create an abstract class named Shape that contains an empty  method named numberOfSides( ). Provide three classes named Rectangle, Triangle and  Hexagon such that each one of the classes extends the class Shape. Each one of the class es contains only the method numberOfSides( ) that shows the number of sides in the giv en geometrical structures. (Exercise to understand polymorphism). **  
6) Write a Java program to demonstrate the use of garbage collector.  
7) Write a file handling program in Java with reader/writer.
8) Write a Java program that read from a file and write to file by handling all file related exceptions. 
9) Write a Java program that reads a line of integers, and then displays each integer, and the sum of all the integers (Use String Tokenizer class of java.util).
